# MemoClarity Hub – Portfolio Project

## About This Project
MemoClarity Hub is a cognitive health and memory monitoring platform for middle-aged and elderly users in the United States.

I rebuilt the entire website from scratch, applying modern web development best practices to deliver a robust, accessible, and visually appealing solution focused on stability, scalability, and user experience.

## My Role
- Hired as a specialist to resolve critical bugs and improve the platform
- Proposed and executed a complete rewrite of the website using React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase
- Designed and implemented a mobile-first, elderly-friendly user experience
- Ensured strict code quality, accessibility, and performance standards

## Technologies Used
- React 18
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS (custom MemoClarity palette)
- shadcn/ui
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- Context API for state management
- Jest + React Testing Library

## Key Features
- Authentication system with demo mode
- Daily check-in for mood, sleep, and energy
- Cognitive games (memory, reaction, sequence)
- Progress dashboard with analytics and gamification
- Card-based navigation for simplicity and accessibility
- Large touch targets and high-contrast UI for elderly users

## Why Rebuild?
The original codebase had multiple architectural and usability issues that limited future growth and user engagement. By rebuilding from scratch, I was able to:
- Eliminate bugs and technical debt
- Implement a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture
- Optimize for mobile devices and accessibility
- Deliver a premium, US-market-ready product
