## Visual Identity Guidelines

### Color Palette
The color palette has been carefully selected based on color psychology to evoke the right emotions: trust, hope, vitality, and renewal.

**Primary Color | Trust and Stability**
- Deep Teal Blue: `#0B4F6C`
- Usage: Main brand color. Ideal for titles, primary buttons, highlight areas, and logo body. Conveys seriousness, calm, intelligence, and the scientific foundation of treatment.

**Secondary Color | Hope and Optimism**
- Vibrant Gold: `#FCA311`
- Usage: Point of light and hope. Perfect for important icons, call-to-action (CTAs), and highlighting "clarity" elements in logo and website. Symbolizes sunrise and the energy of rediscovery.

**Accent Color | Warmth and Vitality**
- Soft Coral: `#FF6F61`
- Usage: To bring a touch of human warmth and care. Use moderately in interaction elements, testimonials, or areas that need a more personal and vibrant feeling.

**Stimulating Color | Renewal and Well-being**
- Soft Aqua Green: `#A7D9D3`
- Usage: Represents freshness, growth, and health. Great for section backgrounds, information cards, or elements that need to convey calm and renewal.

**Neutrals | Clarity and Readability**
- Soft White: `#F8F9FA`
- Usage: Main background color. More comfortable for eyes than pure white, ideal for older audiences and long reading sessions.
- Dark Gray (Text): `#212529`
- Usage: Body text color. Offers high contrast and excellent readability without the harshness of absolute black.

### Typography
Font combination chosen to be modern, highly readable, and with a human touch, ensuring accessibility and a pleasant reading experience.

**Heading Font: Poppins**
- Why: Clean, geometric font with rounded corners that makes it friendly and welcoming. Conveys professionalism without being cold. Great for menus, section titles, and any highlight text.
- Suggested weight: SemiBold or Bold for main titles, Regular for subtitles.

**Body Text Font: Nunito Sans**
- Why: One of the most readable fonts for screen. Its rounded endings give a soft and friendly sensation, making long paragraph reading a comfortable and effortless experience.
- Suggested weight: Regular for all body text.

### Implementation in Code
- Use Tailwind CSS custom colors: `text-teal-800`, `bg-amber-400`, `text-coral-500`, `bg-aqua-200`
- Import Google Fonts: Poppins (400, 600, 700) and Nunito Sans (400, 600)
- Ensure WCAG accessibility standards with color contrasts
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography scales

### Iconography & Card Layering Pattern
To ensure a consistent, premium visual language across dashboard cards, follow this layered icon pattern for feature cards (applies to the 6 main cards on the dashboard):

- Structure (static, no animated progress by default):
	- Outer frame (prominent): visible ring or border that uses a card-specific color (higher contrast). This outer frame should be the most noticeable part of the icon framing.
	- Outer glow tint: subtle background tint or glow using a semi-transparent version of the outer frame color.
	- Inner frame (neutral): thin secondary ring in a neutral tone (white/60) to create separation.
	- Soft inner fill: a small translucent fill behind the icon to add depth (e.g. white/10 or soft aqua/10).
	- Primary icon: monochrome vector icon (single color) centered inside the frames. Prefer stroke icons (lucide-react) with controlled strokeWidth.
	- Corner badge (optional): small rounded badge placed in the top-right to indicate an action/state (e.g., arrow for progress, star for highlight). Keep it minimal (14â€“18px icon) and high contrast.

- Sizes & spacing (recommended):
	- Frame container: 72â€“80px square (use 76px in Tailwind classes for consistency).
	- Primary icon size: 32â€“40px.
	- Corner badge size: 14â€“18px (placed at -top-1 -right-1 with small padding).

- Color mapping (suggested):
	- Go to Test Page: outer frame = teal/aqua (use `cyan/teal` tones). Corner badge: ArrowUpRight (progress cue).
	- Go to Raffle Page: outer frame = gold/amber (use `amber-300/400` hues). Corner badge: small star or gift highlight.
	- Highest Score: outer frame = teal (accent), inner icon = trophy (monochrome).
	- Tests Taken: outer frame = soft neutral (white/20 with yellow border), inner icon = checklist/paper.
	- Track: outer frame = yellow/orange (chart accent), inner icon = bar-chart/line.
	- Support: outer frame = teal-green, inner icon = life-buoy or chat bubble.

- Implementation notes:
	- Use `lucide-react` icons for consistency and accessibility. Prefer stroke icons and control strokeWidth.
	- Keep icons monochrome (single hue) to avoid visual noise; use the framed layers for color and emphasis.
	- Avoid adding animated progress arcs unless representing live progress. Use static arcs/rings only as decorative framing.
	- Ensure sufficient contrast between icon and background (WCAG AA minimum).
